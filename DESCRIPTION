Description: The interaction between genes can be represented as a scale-free directed network. 
  A common practice is to infer the strength of signals for genes and their downstream functions based on gene expression levels. 
  Although this approach is simple, it does not consider prior information on gene-gene interactions. 
  To incorporate prior information on gene interactions into the model, a non-parametric transformation of transcript expression is a worthwhile consideration. 
  transGI has compiled several methods and pairs of gene interactions from previously published literature, 
  allowing users to quantitatively construct gene interaction networks de novo.
